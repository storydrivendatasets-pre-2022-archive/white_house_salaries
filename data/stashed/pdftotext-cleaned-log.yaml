About this log:

The salary pdfs for 2017, 2018, and 2019, ultimately required hand-cleaning.

The originals are in: data/stashed/originals/pdftotext

The hand-cleaned are in: data/stashed/handcleaned

I searched through each respective pdftotext output using this regex:

  \s{40,}(?!For|Page|ANNUAL|As of|POSITION TITLE|WHITE HOUSE OFFICE$|EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT$)(\w+.*)$

  This would also work:

  Per Annum\s*$

And I hand-cleaned the job titles that were found to be spread across multiple lines
by concatenating them to the line belonging to the person with the job title
(indicated with `cleanjob` in the yaml)

I *cleared* -- i.e. blanked out -- but did not *delete* the lines
with the orphan job titles, so each employee record should still have the same
record_line number as in the original pdftotext output.
